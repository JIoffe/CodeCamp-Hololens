# Living, Breathing, Digital - Bending Reality with the Microsoft Hololens

## Materials for Code Camp presentation

These are the projects and assets used in my presentations for the Hololens during NYC and Boston code camp(s).
Note, the Holotoolkit is a dependency. All visuals, scripts, and sounds are created by me.

Feel free to explore the code, but please do not redistribute these assets.
